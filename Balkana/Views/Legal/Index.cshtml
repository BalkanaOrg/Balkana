                    This provisional legal summary acts as a placeholder while the full policy suite,
                    tournament rulebooks, and supplemental guidelines are finalized. Nothing here overrides
                    a written agreement signed with Balkana, but all participants are expected to respect
                    the spirit of these notes.

                    <strong>Heads up:</strong> Expect regular updates as competitive formats evolve,
                    new seasons launch, and partner federations add their own compliance layers.

                <p>
                    By entering any Balkana-hosted competition, you acknowledge that referees may request
                    competitive integrity checks (hardware inspections, POV recordings, third-party account
                    reviews, etc.). Refusals can lead to match forfeits or season bans. Once the official
                    Tournament Rulebook is published, the stricter clause will prevail.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Account sharing, smurfing, or alias stacking is forbidden.</li>
                    <li>Players must comply with anti-cheat directives from partner platforms (FACEIT, Riot, Valve, etc.).</li>
                    <li>Disputes are settled by the Tournament Operations group whose decision is temporarily final.</li>

                <p>
                    Streams, highlight packages, and written recaps produced under the Balkana brand may reuse
                    player handles, likenesses, and non-exclusive footage to promote the league. Teams retain
                    their own branding and can request takedowns of sensitive material, but Balkana reserves
                    the right to archive matches for competitive integrity reviews.

                <p>
                    Limited personal data (IGNs, Discord IDs, nationality, roster history) is processed to verify
                    eligibility and produce stats. Extended privacy clauses—including retention windows and
                    GDPR/CCPA specifics—will sit in the definitive Privacy Notice. Until then, email
                    <a href="mailto:legal@balkana.gg">legal@balkana.gg</a> for data removal or export requests.

                <p>
                    Urgent rulings go through the Tournament Director on duty. Formal legal inquiries,
                    partnership requests, or notices of alleged rule violations should be sent to
                    <a href="mailto:legal@balkana.gg">legal@balkana.gg</a> with match IDs, timestamps,
                    and any supporting evidence. Expect a response within two business days.
