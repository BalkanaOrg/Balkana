                <p>
                    Some browsers include a "Do Not Track" (DNT) feature that signals to websites you visit that you do not want to have your online 
                    activity tracked. Currently, there is no universal standard for how to interpret DNT signals.

                    We do not currently respond to DNT browser signals. However, you can control cookies through your browser settings as described 
                    in Section 5 above. We respect your privacy choices and will continue to monitor developments in DNT technology.
